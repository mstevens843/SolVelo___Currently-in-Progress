📄 README + Interview Story for Your Trading Bot
Let’s title it:

Solana Auto-Trader (Public MVP)
A modular, strategy-driven Solana bot built to analyze, react, and trade on-chain using multiple market behaviors.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Solana/web3.js, Jupiter API, dotenv

Frontend (optional GUI phase): React + Vite

Tooling: Render, SQLite (future), Telegram Bot API

🔁 Core Strategies (Modular Services)
Each strategy lives inside services/ as a standalone file and can be toggled independently.


Strategy	Description
scalper.js	Repeated trades on short intervals (volatility farming)
sniper.js	Detects new tokens on Jupiter and buys fast
breakout.js	Buys based on price + volume spikes (breakout detection)
chadMode.js	High-risk fast entry with optional dump logic
dipBuyer.js	Monitors tokens and buys after sudden price drops
paperTrader.js	Simulates all of the above for test-mode trade logs
⚙️ Features
Modular strategy execution (CLI or dashboard-ready)

Real-time token analysis using Jupiter + custom triggers

Supports slippage config, trade intervals, dynamic token targeting

Configurable .env based setup

Fast wallet signing via base58 private key import

Built-in priority fee logic for faster TXs (Chad Mode)

Auto-sell logic (in Chad Mode, for single-candle flips)

Clean logs for TX success/failure, route details, and impact %

🧠 Interview Story / Pitch
“I built a Solana-based modular trading bot that supports multiple strategies like scalping, sniping, and breakout detection. I didn’t just write swap logic — I engineered the backend to be fully modular, so I can toggle modes from a CLI or dashboard. I integrated Jupiter’s API to fetch the best token swap routes and used raw transaction signing with priority fees for faster execution. Each strategy runs independently, so I can scale or A/B test logic like candle-breakouts versus dip-buys.
It’s built to be public now, but I plan to evolve it into a private version with mempool-based sniping and Telegram alerts, kind of like a mini MEV bot for Solana.”

Would you like me to:

Format this into a full README.md and drop it in?

Or build the dashboard next (to launch strategies via GUI)?

Or write the Telegram alert file (telegram/bot.js)?
