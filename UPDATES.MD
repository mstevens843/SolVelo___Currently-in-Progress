✅ Phase 1: Start/Stop Bot Lifecycle (Complete)
🎯 Goals:
Start/Stop strategy from UI

Reflect running status in real-time

Show proper toast feedback + visual state

🔧 What We Did:
✅ Connected StartStopControls to backend POST /api/mode/start and /stop

✅ Added loading states: "⏳ Starting...", "🛑 Stopping..."

✅ Added disabled state logic (greyed out buttons when invalid)

✅ Improved UX: shows warning toast if no strategy selected

✅ Verified currentModeProcess tracking works in backend

✅ Confirmed graceful shutdown: SIGINT triggers clean code: null exit

✅ Synced frontend with real-time running status via /status

✅ Phase 2: Strategy Config + Mode Locking While Running
🎯 Goals:
Lock UI controls while bot is active

Prevent user from changing strategy or config mid-run

🔧 What We Did:
✅ Passed disabled={running} to ModeSelector and ConfigPanel

✅ Updated ModeSelector to disable <select> while bot is running

✅ Added tooltip: “Stop the bot to change mode”

✅ Updated ConfigPanel inputs to:

Lock slippage, interval, and maxTrades while running

Add tooltips explaining why

✅ Confirmed working with state persistence + reactivity

✅ Backend Safety Enhancements
🎯 Goals:
Harden each strategy to avoid tx failures

Add SOL balance checks before swaps

🔧 What We Did:
✅ For sniper, trendFollower, rotationBot, rebalancer:

Added getWalletBalance() checks before execution

Ensured minimum SOL (0.01) present for tx fees

✅ Prevented unnecessary RPC calls if wallet is too low

✅ Confirmed proper use of getWallet() + getWalletBalance() pattern

✅ Code Organization & Clarity Fixes
✅ Replaced deprecated req.setModeProcess() with global-scoped currentModeProcess

✅ Fixed misused dynamic import logic (e.g. botController.js injection removed)

✅ Confirmed SIGINT works and does not log as error

✅ Removed broken fallback paths, ensured spawn(...) uses correct service path

✅ Clarified function structure: module.exports = async function strategyName() {...} cleaned up
